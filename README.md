# kaggle_titanic
First Kaggle competition on the Titanic data set.

The competition description can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

This challenge is short and easy but it still allows us to explore some cool features of Sklearn (GridSearch) or how to deal with missing data.

The submission perform 78,4% of accuracy and may be improved by tweaking the model or try something else like Gradient Boosting.
